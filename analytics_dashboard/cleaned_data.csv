Usually, I teach spring, fall, and summer (fewer courses are allowed to be taught during shorter summer semesters). Sometimes courses are cancelled right before the semester starts (after doing all the prep) or you are only assigned 1 course.  So the estimate given for 52 weeks at full time (for 1 school max classes) is a big estimate and a closer number would be $17,000 (that is if all classes make and I am at the max assigned) because teaching is not all year (16 weeks fall and spring, 8 weeks summer - usually).

There's hourly pay for hands on hours only, and we have to do other work between sessions that is unpaid and folded into what we get paid for the sessions. So officially, a standard workweek is 24 hours a week, and that's what we're paid for, while doing about 18 hours of additional ""unpaid"" prep and charting. Our hourly rate is higher than it would otherwise be to account for these hours.
